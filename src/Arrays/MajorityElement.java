/*The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times  in a array.
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
we are using Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm here - 
We choose the first person we see as our current "candidate" for majority
We give them 1 vote (count = 1)
Then for each new person:

If they support our candidate: add 1 vote
If they oppose our candidate: remove 1 vote


If votes reach 0, we choose the next person as our new candidate
